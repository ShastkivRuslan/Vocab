    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Last updated: December 22, 2025</strong></p>

    <p>This Privacy Policy describes how <strong>Vocab+</strong> (the "App"), developed by <strong>Ruslan Shastkiv</strong>, collects, uses, and shares information when you use our mobile application.</p>

    <h2>1. Information Collection and Use</h2>
    <p>We do not require you to provide any personally identifiable information to use the basic features of Vocab. The App is designed to help you learn vocabulary efficiently.</p>

    <h2>2. Artificial Intelligence Services</h2>
    <p>Vocab utilizes third-party AI services, including <strong>OpenAI</strong> and <strong>Google Gemini</strong>, to provide advanced language features. When you interact with AI-powered tools within the App, the text inputs you provide may be transmitted to these providers for processing. These third parties have their own privacy policies governing how they handle data.</p>

    <h2>3. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>The App uses Google Play Services, which may collect information used to identify you. You can find their privacy policy here:
        <a href="https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/" target="_blank">Google Privacy & Terms</a>.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Future Payments and Subscriptions</h2>
    <p>Vocab is currently a free application. However, we may offer paid features or subscriptions in the future. All financial transactions will be processed securely through the <strong>Google Play Billing system</strong>. We do not collect or store your financial details (such as credit card numbers) on our servers.</p>

    <h2>5. Log Data</h2>
    <p>In the event of an error in the App, we may collect data and information (through third-party products) on your device called Log Data. This may include your device's IP address, name, operating system version, and the time/date of your use of the service.</p>

    <h2>6. Security</h2>
    <p>We value your trust in using Vocab, and we strive to use commercially acceptable means of protecting any data processed by the App. However, no method of transmission over the internet is 100% secure.</p>

    <h2>7. Contact Us</h2>
    <p>If you have any questions or suggestions regarding this Privacy Policy, please contact us at:</p>
